Punk Pints

The Brief

Weekend homework from week 7 of the CodeClan professional software development course.

I created a un, interactive app using the Punk API - a searchable, filterable record of Brew Dog's expansive back cataglogue. Users type a number between 1 and 80. The app returns them a beer selected from Punk API -  If the user has already had this beer and enjoyed it they can add it to a "had" list, alternatively if they like the sound of it they can add it to a "want" list. 

Getting Started

Install depenencies 
In the terminal: 
npm i 

Run the app 
npm start
This should automatically open http://localhost:3000 in the browser


Future Considerations

Bugs I have noticed which I would like to fix:
1. The user can add to the lists before a beer has been selected, this adds an empty item to the list
2. Once a beer has been added to the list I would like this beer to not be served to the user again
