# Punk Pints

## The Brief

A mini project inspired by the Weekend homework from week 7 of the CodeClan professional software development course.I created a fun, interactive app using the Punk API - a searchable, filterable record of Brew Dog's expansive back cataglogue (https://punkapi.com/). Users type a number between 1 and 80. The app returns them a beer selected from Punk API -  If the user has already had this beer and enjoyed it they can add it to a "had" list, alternatively if they like the sound of it they can add it to a "want" list. 

## Getting Started

# Install depenencies 
`npm i` 

# Run the app 
`npm start`
This should automatically open http://localhost:3000 in the browser


## Changes I'd ike to Make
1. Currently the user can add to the lists before a beer has been selected, this adds an empty item to the list. I'd like to fix this.
2. Once a beer has been added to the list I would like this beer to not be served to the user again.
